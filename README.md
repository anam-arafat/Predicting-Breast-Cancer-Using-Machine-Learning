# Predicting Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning

## Description
This project aims to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign by building and implementing three Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The project involves exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive and dynamic visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization and graphical representation.
- **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification.
- **Decision Tree**: For decision-making model implementation.
- **Random Forest**: For ensemble learning and improving classification accuracy.
